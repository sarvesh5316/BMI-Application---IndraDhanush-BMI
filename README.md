Body mass index (BMI) is a measure of body fat based on height and weight that applies to adult men and women. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.

The formula for BMI is:

BMI = weight (kg) / height (m)^2
For example, if a person weighs 70 kilograms and is 1.7 meters tall, their BMI would be 24.2.

The World Health Organization (WHO) defines the following BMI categories for adults:

Underweight: BMI < 18.5
Healthy weight: BMI 18.5–24.9
Overweight: BMI 25.0–29.9
Obesity: BMI ≥ 30.0
The WHO also defines different BMI categories for children and adolescents.

BMI is a useful screening tool for weight status, but it is important to remember that it is just one measure of health. Other factors, such as body fat distribution, muscle mass, and overall health, should also be considered when assessing a person's health.

Here are some of the limitations of BMI:

It does not take into account body fat distribution. People with a lot of muscle mass may have a high BMI, even if they have a low body fat percentage.
It does not account for age, sex, or race. BMI standards may not be accurate for all people.
It is a relatively simple calculation and may not be accurate for people with certain medical conditions, such as edema.
If you are concerned about your BMI, talk to your doctor. They can help you assess your overall health and develop a plan to reach a healthy weight.

Here are some of the health risks associated with being overweight or obese:

Heart disease
Stroke
Type 2 diabetes
Certain types of cancer
Sleep apnea
Osteoarthritis
Gallbladder disease
High blood pressure
Depression
If you are overweight or obese, there are things you can do to lose weight and improve your health. These include:

Eating a healthy diet
Exercising regularly
Getting enough sleep
Managing stress
If you are trying to lose weight, it is important to do so in a healthy way. Talk to your doctor about a safe and effective weight loss plan for you.
